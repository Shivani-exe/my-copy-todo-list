# JAMStack + Netlify + Astra + Cassandra Example ðŸ“’
This is an example React To-Do application using a [DataStax Astra](https://astra.datastax.com/register) free tier database.

This example interacts directly with the database from the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) frontend and can be deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free with a few clicks.

Contributor(s): [SebastiÃ¡n EstÃ©vez](https://github.com/phact), based on the work of [Jake Luciani](https://github.com/tjake/todo-astra-react-serverless/)

## Objectives
* Provide a fullstack development example using Astra as the storage backend

## How this works
Once the Astra credentials are provided, the necessary tables are created in the database. The webservice will be available on port 8080 once the application has been deployed.

[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) is a big leap forward in how we can write web applications that are easy to write, deploy, scale, and also maintain. Using this approach means that newly created content is rendered from a content API, while a static render of it is being built into the site for future.

## Getting Started Paths:
1. [Run the app locally](#running-on-your-local-machine)
2. [Run the app on Gitpod](#running-on-gitpod)
3. [Deploy the app to Netlify](#deploying-to-netlify)

### Running on your local machine
1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/register) and free-tier Cassandra database:

2. Click 'Use this template' at the top of the README:

3. Enter a repository name and click 'Create repository from template':

4. Clone the repository on your local machine:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3254549/88739059-6e53c900-d0ee-11ea-9b25-56b2436a9817.png)
5. `cd` to the cloned repository, and install Node dependencies: `npm install`.
6. Populate your environment variables into a .env file

```
cp .env-template .env
```

and modify .env to include your database specific values (you can find these in the database detail screen in the Astra UI).

```
ASTRA_DB_ID=REPLACE-ME
ASTRA_DB_REGION=REPLACE-ME
ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE=REPLACE-ME
ASTRA_DB_PASSWORD=REPLACE-ME
ASTRA_DB_USERNAME=REPLACE-ME
```


7. In the cloned repository, build the app: `npm start`.
8. Open http://localhost:8080 to view your application:

### Running on Gitpod
1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/register) and free-tier Cassandra database:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3254549/88737275-c938f080-d0ed-11ea-8273-f547da8ef9e6.png)
2. Once you have created both an Astra account and database, click the 'Open in Gitpod' link:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://dtsx.io/3gtADSq)

3. Wait for your Gitpod workspace to start:
